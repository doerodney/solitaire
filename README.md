## Description
I found a marble solitaire board hiding under a sofa.  It looks like [this:](https://www.amazon.com/Marble-Solitaire-Made-in-USA/dp/B000CEMCFK)

The board has centered rows of marbles of length 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 3.  With all but one cell filled, the goal is to remove marbles by jumping horizontally or vertically (no diagonal jumps), ultimately leaving one marble on the board. This project is a simulator that attempts to solve marble solitaire.
